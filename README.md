> _“We pry open systems to see how the world actually runs.”_

I’m **0xbin4ry**, low‑level developer and researcher focused on reverse engineering and offensive security. I explore system internals, build proofs‑of‑concept, and solve CTFs to sharpen practical skills.

## What I do
- **Reverse Engineering:** unpacking binaries, analyzing control flow and data structures, rebuilding intent from disassembly.  
- **Low‑Level Development:** kernel and userland tooling, exploit primitives, and small, auditable POCs.  
- **Offensive Security:** end‑to‑end assessments on lab targets; vulnerability classification and exploitation techniques.  
- **CTF Play:** challenge solves that drive practical research and concise write‑ups.

## What’s on this site
- Vulnerable machine write‑ups
- CTF solutions & breakdowns
- Exploit & RE tutorials
- Study notes & reviews

## Why I publish this
- To refine technique and documentation for real‑world security assessments and red team engagements.
- To share repeatable methodologies, tooling notes, and lessons learned for others studying offensive security.
