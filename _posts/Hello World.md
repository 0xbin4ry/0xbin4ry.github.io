# Cybersecurity Writeups & Notes
Welcome to my GitPage: [0xbin4ry.github.io](https://0xbin4ry.github.io)  
This site is a curated hub for my practical cybersecurity work: machine walkthroughs, CTF solutions, and study reflections aimed at improving technical reporting and hands‑on skills

## 🔍 What’s here
- **Write-ups for vulnerable machines** (Hack The Box, Try Hack Me, Offensive Security, etc.)  
- **CTF challenge solutions & breakdowns**  
- **Certification review notes & study reflections**
- **Tutorials — reverse engineering and exploit development**

## 💡 Why I publish this
- To refine technique and documentation for real‑world security assessments and red team engagements
- To share repeatable methodologies, tooling notes, and lessons learned for others studying offensive security

## ⚠️ Quick pointers
- Each write-up includes: scope, attack path, commands used, and remediation notes
- Contributions and constructive feedback welcome — find source and contact links on the site
